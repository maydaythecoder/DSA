# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in both JavaScript and Python. The goal is to provide a resource for learning and understanding the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, with examples in two popular programming languages.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `JavaScript/`
- `Python/`

Each language directory contains two subdirectories:

- `DataStructures/`
- `Algorithms/`

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in both JavaScript and Python:

- **Array**: A collection of elements identified by index.
- **LinkedList**: A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next node.
- **Queue**: A collection of elements that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
- **Stack**: A collection of elements that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.

### DataStructures in JavaScript

- `Array.js`: Implementation of array operations.
- `LinkedList.js`: Implementation of a singly linked list.
- `Queue.js`: Implementation of a queue.
- `Stacks.js`: Implementation of a stack.

### DataStructures in Python

- `array.py`: Implementation of array operations.
- `linked_list.py`: Implementation of a singly linked list.
- `queue.py`: Implementation of a queue.
- `stacks.py`: Implementation of a stack.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in both JavaScript and Python:

- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted.
- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element until the target is found or the list ends.

### Algorithms in JavaScript

- `BinarySearch.js`: Implementation of binary search algorithm.
- `BubbleSort.js`: Implementation of bubble sort algorithm.
- `LinearSearch.js`: Implementation of linear search algorithm.

### Algorithms in Python

- `binary_search.py`: Implementation of binary search algorithm.
- `bubble_sort.py`: Implementation of bubble sort algorithm.
- `linear_search.py`: Implementation of linear search algorithm.
